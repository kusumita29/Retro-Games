There are so many childhood games that we have almost forgotten but are so fun to play. 

We are creating a Python GUI where we will add all the retro games and you can play whichever you want with just a click.

Currently, there are three games:
1. Tetris
2. Flappy Bird
3. Space Fight (2-player) 
4. Tic-Tac-Toe
